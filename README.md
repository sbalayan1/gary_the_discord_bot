## About
Gary is a discord chatbot by Sean Balayan that integrates ChatGPT.


## What am I currently working on?
- Responses from chatGPT are shortened for some odd reason. Working to fixed


## TO DO
- Should not be able to send commands unless the bot is online
- Command List
    - /askGPT (searchTerm) -> takes a question/direction/input as an argument and returns a response from ChatGPT
    - /gif (searchTerm) -> takes a search value as an argument and returns a random gif
    - /clear -> clears discord chat


## Other
- interesting problem I experienced. 
    -> created an interaction while guide bot was off. 
    -> once i turned bot back on, I was able to make an interaction but the server crashed because the previous command was still queued?
